# project-portfolio
This portfolio presents a selection of code from various projects I have worked on in the past.

The portfolio is divided into two categories:

## Code Samples
These examples are drawn from projects where I am unable to share the entire source code due to various restrictions. In these instances, I have included a class or a set of classes that highlight some unique aspects of the work I contributed to the project.

The following are partial code samples:

[Chess Logic](https://github.com/TheHaystackKing/project-portfolio/tree/main/chess-logic) - This sample is from my capstone project, where we developed a mobile game for a client that offers a variation on chess. This particular section features the back-end logic for the game's rules, including movement rules, game mechanics, and a chess AI.

[Calendar Sync](https://github.com/TheHaystackKing/project-portfolio/tree/main/calendar-sync) - This sample is from a project for a client establishing a rental company. The featured class was created to synchronize bookings across three different websites using three different calendars, ensuring no double bookings occurred.

## Complete Source Code
These examples come from projects where I am free to share the complete source code. These projects are hosted in separate repositories linked below. They are also available as public repositories on my GitHub account.

The following are examples of complete source code:

[Family Map](https://github.com/TheHaystackKing/family-map) - An Android mobile app inspired by platforms like FamilySearch or Ancestry, which visualizes family trees and allows basic interaction with life events.

[Tweeter](https://github.com/TheHaystackKing/tweeter) - An Android mobile app with a back-end originally hosted on AWS. The app is designed to emulate Twitter, incorporating key features such as user following, posting, and a personalized feed displaying posts from followed users.

Feel free to explore my GitHub account for additional code examples.
